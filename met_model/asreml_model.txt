Experiment = trial
Genotype (acc_num) = gen
Response Varaible (predicted.values) = resp

number of varaince components (n.VC) is 20 if
Genotype fixed
Experiment fixed

number of varaince components (n.VC) is 21 if
Genotype random
Experiment fixed

number of varaince components (n.VC) is 22 if
Genotype random
Experiment random

If genotype is assumed as fixed, the computer can not process the FA because not enought memory
